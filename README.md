# SugarcaneYCS
## Investigating Yellow Canopy Syndrome in sugarcane plants, using an RNAseq approach.

This work is a collaboration between Kate Wathen-Dunn of Sugar Research Australia and Dr Kate Hertweck of the University of Texas in Tyler.
See the k8hertweck/ycs github repository for the slurm scripts used on the TACC/Stampede server.

The research consisted of the de novo assembly of sugarcane RNAseq reads from 70 leaf samples of YCS-symptomatic and asymptomatic Controls,
using multiple assembly tools and kmers, and the clustering and merging of the assemblies to create a single reference transcriptome. 
This reference transcriptome was then used in differential expression analysis and gene ontology enrichment analysis.
