# SugarcaneYCS
## Investigating Yellow Canopy Syndrome in sugarcane plants, using an RNAseq approach.

This work is a collaboration between Kate Wathen-Dunn of Sugar Research Australia and Dr Kate Hertweck of the University of Texas in Tyler
(see the k8hertweck/ycs github repository for the slurm scripts used on the TACC/Stampede server).

The research consists of the de novo assembly of sugarcane RNAseq reads from 70 leaf samples of YCS-symptomatic and asymptomatic Controls,
using multiple assembly tools and kmers, and the attempted merging of the assemblies to create a single reference transcriptome,
followed by differential expression analysis and gene ontology enrichment analysis.
